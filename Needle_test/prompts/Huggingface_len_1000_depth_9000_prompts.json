And the\nscary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.We wouldn't want to stop it.  It's the same process that cures\ndiseases: technological progress.  Technological progress means\nmaking things do more of what we want.  When the thing we want is\nsomething we want to want, we consider technological progress good.\nIf some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that\nseems strictly better.  When progress concentrates something we\ndon't want to want\u2014when it transforms opium into heroin\u2014it seems\nbad.  But it's the same process at work.\n[1]No one doubts this process is accelerating, which means increasing\nnumbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like\ntoo much.\n[2]As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much.\nThe closest is the colloquial sense of \"addictive.\" That usage has\nbecome increasingly common during my lifetime.  And it's clear why:\nthere are an increasing number of things we need it for.  At the\nextreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth.  Food has been\ntransformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in\nfood processing into something with way more immediate bang for the\nbuck, and you can see the results in any town in America.  Checkers\nand solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille.\nTV has become much more engaging, and even so it can't compete with Facebook.The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.   And unless\nthe forms of technological progress that produced these things are\nsubject to different laws than technological progress in general,\nthe world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did\nin the last 40.The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things.  I don't\nmean to imply they're all to be avoided.  Alcohol is a dangerous\ndrug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without.\nMost people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.\nMore things we like will mean more things we have to be careful\nabout.Most people won't, unfortunately.  Which means that as the world\nbecomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a\nnormal life will be driven ever further apart.  One sense of \"normal\"\nis statistically normal: what everyone else does.  The other is the\nsense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a\npiece of machinery: what works best.These two senses are already quite far apart.  Already someone\ntrying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of\nthe US.  That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced.\nYou can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if\npeople don't think you're weird, you're living badly.Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things.\nI've seen that happen with cigarettes.  When cigarettes first\nappeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through\na previously isolated population.  Smoking rapidly became a\n(statistically) normal thing.  There were ashtrays everywhere.  We\nhad ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of\nmy parents smoked.  You had to for guests.As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed.\nIn the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed\n\nRead the document and answer: What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?
